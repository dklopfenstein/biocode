The *Ideo* file underlies the graphic display of the cytoband data in the small ideogram graphic above the main UCSC Browser display. Items in the last column (e.g. gneg, gpos, gvar, stalk, acen, etc.) are the names of the band in accordance with the standards defined by the ISCN 1995 manual and are used to the coloring seen in the UCSC Browser graphic.

* **gneg**: is a light stain
* **gpos**: is a dark stain ([dark] gpos25, gpos50, gpos75, and gpos100 [darkest])
* **acen**: short for acrocentric; bands adjacent to centromere.
* **gvar**: variable heterochromatic regions; either pericentric or telomeric
* **stalk**: regions on the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes ch13, 14, 15, 21, 22 that have a "stalk-like" appearance.
