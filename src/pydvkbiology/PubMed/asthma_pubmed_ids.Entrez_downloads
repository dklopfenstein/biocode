AB  - There is evidence that genetic factors are implicated in the observed differences
      in therapeutic responses to the common classes of asthma therapy such as
      beta2-agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Pharmacogenomics
      explores the roles of genetic variation in drug response and continues to be a
      field of great interest in asthma therapy. Prior studies have focused on
      candidate genes and recently emphasized genome-wide association analyses. Newer
      integrative omics and system-level approaches have recently revealed novel
      understanding of drug response pathways. However, the current known genetic loci 
      only account for a fraction of variability in drug response and ongoing research 
      is needed. While the field of asthma pharmacogenomics is not yet fully
      translatable to clinical practice, ongoing research should hopefully achieve this
      goal in the near future buttressed by the recent precision medicine efforts in
      the USA and worldwide.

AB  - Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory disease 
      characterized clinically by the triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and
      pathognomonic respiratory reactions after ingestion of aspirin. It is a distinct 
      syndrome associated with eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory tissues and
      excessive production of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Despite the consistent clinical
      phenotype of the respiratory disease, the underlying pathogenesis of the disease 
      remains unclear. In addition to their role in hemostasis, platelets have the
      capacity to influence the activation state and function of other immune cells
      during inflammation and to facilitate granulocyte recruitment into the tissues.
      Platelets also possess a repertoire of potent preformed mediators of inflammation
      that are released on activation and are a rich source of newly synthesized lipid 
      mediators that alter vascular permeability and smooth muscle tone. Accordingly,
      platelet activity has been linked to diverse inflammatory diseases, including
      asthma. Both human and animal studies strongly suggest that platelet activity is 
      uniquely associated with the pathophysiology of AERD. This article summarizes the
      evidence supporting an effector role for platelets in asthmatic patients in
      general and in patients with AERD in particular and considers the potential
      therapeutic implications.

TI  - Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline
      granulocytes.
PG  - 247-55

AB  - The 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) is
      the most powerful human eosinophil chemoattractant among lipid mediators and
      could play a major pathophysiological role in eosinophilic diseases such as
      asthma. Its actions are mediated by the OXE receptor, orthologs of which are
      found in many species from humans to fish, but not rodents. The unavailability of
      rodent models to examine the pathophysiological roles of 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE
      receptor has substantially hampered progress in this area. As an alternative, we 
      have explored the possibility that the cat could serve as an appropriate animal
      model to investigate the role of 5-oxo-ETE. We found that feline peripheral blood
      leukocytes synthesize 5-oxo-ETE and that physiologically relevant levels of
      5-oxo-ETE are present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cats with
      experimentally induced asthma. 5-Oxo-ETE (EC50, 0.7nM) is a much more potent
      activator of actin polymerization in feline eosinophils than various other
      eicosanoids, including leukotriene (LT) B4 and prostaglandin D2. 5-Oxo-ETE and
      LTB4 induce feline leukocyte migration to similar extents at low concentrations
      (1nM), but at higher concentrations the response to 5-oxo-ETE is much greater.
      Although high concentrations of selective human OXE receptor antagonists blocked 
      5-oxo-ETE-induced actin polymerization in feline granulocytes, their potencies
      were about 200 times lower than for human granulocytes. We conclude that feline
      leukocytes synthesize and respond to 5-oxo-ETE, which could potentially play an
      important role in feline asthma, a common condition in this species. The cat
      could serve as a useful animal model to investigate the pathophysiological role
      of 5-oxo-ETE.

TI  - Platelet-driven leukotriene C4-mediated airway inflammation in mice is
      aspirin-sensitive and depends on T prostanoid receptors.
PG  - 5061-8
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1402959 [doi]
AB  - Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are bronchoconstricting lipid mediators that
      amplify eosinophilic airway inflammation by incompletely understood mechanisms.
      We recently found that LTC4, the parent cysLT, potently activates platelets in
      vitro and induces airway eosinophilia in allergen-sensitized and -challenged mice
      by a platelet- and type 2 cysLT receptor-dependent pathway. We now demonstrate
      that this pathway requires production of thromboxane A2 and signaling through
      both hematopoietic and lung tissue-associated T prostanoid (TP) receptors.
      Intranasal administration of LTC4 to OVA-sensitized C57BL/6 mice markedly
      increased the numbers of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, while
      simultaneously decreasing the percentages of eosinophils in the blood by a TP
      receptor-dependent mechanism. LTC4 upregulated the expressions of ICAM-1 and
      VCAM-1 in an aspirin-sensitive and TP receptor-dependent manner. Both
      hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic TP receptors were essential for LTC4 to induce
      eosinophil recruitment. Thus, the autocrine and paracrine functions of
      thromboxane A2 act downstream of LTC4/type 2 cysLT receptor signaling on
      platelets to markedly amplify eosinophil recruitment through pulmonary vascular
      adhesion pathways. The findings suggest applications for TP receptor antagonists 
      in cases of asthma with high levels of cysLT production.
