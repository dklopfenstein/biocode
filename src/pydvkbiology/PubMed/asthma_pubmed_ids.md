* **Title**         : Asthma Pharmacogenomics: 2015 Update.
* **Journal Title** : Current allergy and asthma reports
* **Date of Pub.**  : 2015 Jul
* **Abstract**
There is evidence that genetic factors are implicated in the observed differences in therapeutic responses to the common classes of asthma therapy such as beta2-agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Pharmacogenomics explores the roles of genetic variation in drug response and continues to be a field of great interest in asthma therapy. Prior studies have focused on candidate genes and recently emphasized genome-wide association analyses. Newer integrative omics and system-level approaches have recently revealed novel understanding of drug response pathways. However, the current known genetic loci only account for a fraction of variability in drug response and ongoing research is needed. While the field of asthma pharmacogenomics is not yet fully translatable to clinical practice, ongoing research should hopefully achieve this goal in the near future buttressed by the recent precision medicine efforts in the USA and worldwide.

* **Title**         : Platelets in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
* **Journal Title** : The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology
* **Date of Pub.**  : 2015 Jun
* **Abstract**
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized clinically by the triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and pathognomonic respiratory reactions after ingestion of aspirin. It is a distinct syndrome associated with eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory tissues and excessive production of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Despite the consistent clinical phenotype of the respiratory disease, the underlying pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. In addition to their role in hemostasis, platelets have the capacity to influence the activation state and function of other immune cells during inflammation and to facilitate granulocyte recruitment into the tissues. Platelets also possess a repertoire of potent preformed mediators of inflammation that are released on activation and are a rich source of newly synthesized lipid mediators that alter vascular permeability and smooth muscle tone. Accordingly, platelet activity has been linked to diverse inflammatory diseases, including asthma. Both human and animal studies strongly suggest that platelet activity is uniquely associated with the pathophysiology of AERD. This article summarizes the evidence supporting an effector role for platelets in asthmatic patients in general and in patients with AERD in particular and considers the potential therapeutic implications.

* **Title**         : Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline granulocytes.
* **Journal Title** : Biochemical pharmacology
* **Date of Pub.**  : 2015 Aug 1
* **Abstract**
The 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) is the most powerful human eosinophil chemoattractant among lipid mediators and could play a major pathophysiological role in eosinophilic diseases such as asthma. Its actions are mediated by the OXE receptor, orthologs of which are found in many species from humans to fish, but not rodents. The unavailability of rodent models to examine the pathophysiological roles of 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor has substantially hampered progress in this area. As an alternative, we have explored the possibility that the cat could serve as an appropriate animal model to investigate the role of 5-oxo-ETE. We found that feline peripheral blood leukocytes synthesize 5-oxo-ETE and that physiologically relevant levels of 5-oxo-ETE are present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cats with experimentally induced asthma. 5-Oxo-ETE (EC50, 0.7nM) is a much more potent activator of actin polymerization in feline eosinophils than various other eicosanoids, including leukotriene (LT) B4 and prostaglandin D2. 5-Oxo-ETE and LTB4 induce feline leukocyte migration to similar extents at low concentrations (1nM), but at higher concentrations the response to 5-oxo-ETE is much greater. Although high concentrations of selective human OXE receptor antagonists blocked 5-oxo-ETE-induced actin polymerization in feline granulocytes, their potencies were about 200 times lower than for human granulocytes. We conclude that feline leukocytes synthesize and respond to 5-oxo-ETE, which could potentially play an important role in feline asthma, a common condition in this species. The cat could serve as a useful animal model to investigate the pathophysiological role of 5-oxo-ETE.

* **Title**         : Platelet-driven leukotriene C4-mediated airway inflammation in mice is aspirin-sensitive and depends on T prostanoid receptors.
* **Journal Title** : Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)
* **Date of Pub.**  : 2015 Jun 1
* **Abstract**
Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are bronchoconstricting lipid mediators that amplify eosinophilic airway inflammation by incompletely understood mechanisms. We recently found that LTC4, the parent cysLT, potently activates platelets in vitro and induces airway eosinophilia in allergen-sensitized and -challenged mice by a platelet- and type 2 cysLT receptor-dependent pathway. We now demonstrate that this pathway requires production of thromboxane A2 and signaling through both hematopoietic and lung tissue-associated T prostanoid (TP) receptors. Intranasal administration of LTC4 to OVA-sensitized C57BL/6 mice markedly increased the numbers of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, while simultaneously decreasing the percentages of eosinophils in the blood by a TP receptor-dependent mechanism. LTC4 upregulated the expressions of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in an aspirin-sensitive and TP receptor-dependent manner. Both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic TP receptors were essential for LTC4 to induce eosinophil recruitment. Thus, the autocrine and paracrine functions of thromboxane A2 act downstream of LTC4/type 2 cysLT receptor signaling on platelets to markedly amplify eosinophil recruitment through pulmonary vascular adhesion pathways. The findings suggest applications for TP receptor antagonists in cases of asthma with high levels of cysLT production.
