# How do capacitors go bad?
```
First they become antisocial. You find them hanging out with
other bad capacitors. They might start smoking. They refuse
to hold a charge for their neighbors. 

Many times, this antisocial behavior can be traced to a
single traumatizing event like an over voltage spike from a
parent. Another path is steady exposure to heat by
insensitive neighbors who do not recognize the  issues
facing the capacitor until one day it starts smoking and
refusing to hold a charge.

It is sad that as a society, we allow such designs to occur.
If anyone wants to create a ribbon campaign to collect money
for antisocial capacitors, I'm in. "Bad caps, bad caps...
whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for
you..." All caps are innocent until proven guilty through an
ESR measurement.
