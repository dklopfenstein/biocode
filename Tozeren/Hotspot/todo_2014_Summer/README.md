1. Please provide me a) table containing the lists of the
diseases, the two letter symbols you call each disease, and
the number of genes it contains and when they were
downloaded. Donâ€™t download them again. This is your Table 1.
Create also an excel sheet providing the list of gene
symbols for each disease. This is your Additional File 1.
  NCBI_downloads.txt

2. Figure 1. Your clusters found in human chromosomes with
d = 20 kb, 50, and 100 kb. This figure is simple and you
already have it. This is for all diseases.

3. Figure 2, your ASCII art for three top clusters for d =
20K on three different chromosomes.

4. Table 2. List of genes and their linkage to diseases for
the most crowded top ten clusters.

5. Your algorithm as Additional File 2.
